Propensity Score Weighting for Win Statistics with Ordinal Outcomes in Randomized Clinical Trials 

Supports propensity score weighting analysis of covariate-adjusted win statistics with ordinal outcomes in randomized clinical trials. This package provides five estimators including unadjusted (without covariate adjustment), IPW (inverse probability treatment weight), OW (overlap weight), AIPW (augmented IPW) and AOW (augmented OW) for calculating the point and interval estimates of the win probability (WP), loss probability (LP), win ratio (WR), and win difference (WD) in randomized trials with ordinal outcomes. We perform the methods considered in Cao et al.(2025) Covariate-adjusted win statistics in randomized clinical trials.

The manual of winPSW package is also provided.
